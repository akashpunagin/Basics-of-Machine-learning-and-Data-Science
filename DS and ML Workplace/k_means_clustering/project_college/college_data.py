# use KMeans Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups: Private and Public
# we actually have the labels for this data set, but we will NOT use them for the KMeans clustering algorithm
# K-means is unsupervised machine learning algorithm, meaning it does not require labels

# The Data
#     Private A factor with levels No and Yes indicating private or public university
#     Apps Number of applications received
#     Accept Number of applications accepted
#     Enroll Number of new students enrolled
#     Top10perc Pct. new students from top 10% of H.S. class
#     Top25perc Pct. new students from top 25% of H.S. class
#     F.Undergrad Number of fulltime undergraduates
#     P.Undergrad Number of parttime undergraduates
#     Outstate Out-of-state tuition
#     Room.Board Room and board costs
#     Books Estimated book costs
#     Personal Estimated personal spending
#     PhD Pct. of faculty with Ph.D.â€™s
#     Terminal Pct. of faculty with terminal degree
#     S.F.Ratio Student/faculty ratio
#     perc.alumni Pct. alumni who donate
#     Expend Instructional expenditure per student
#     Grad.Rate Graduation rate
